print("You find yourself standing before the delapitated Hopehaven Estate, which has been shuttered for decades. This building has a long and tragic history. It was ran by the state and has served as an orphanage, a TB sanitarum, a mental institution, and a nursing home. The crumbling facade is covered in graffiti and ivy. It's doors and windows boarded up, save for those on the upper floors which are mostly shattered. The surrounding area is mostly overgrown and with trash and debris strewn about/ The grounds are enclosed within a rusty chainlink fence that fell into disrepair, so it wasn't difficult to gain access. Your friend flew his new high-end drone through an upper window to capture some video with it, but inexplicably lost contact with it. Affraid of going in himself, he offered you $50 to go in and retrieve it for him. On top of having no flashlight, crowbar, or any other tools, the sun is setting so it will be dark soon.\n")
